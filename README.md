# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This is an opportunity for you to implement some of the "juicy" features as demonstrated in the 2012 GDC presentation, "Juice it or Lose it."

I have provided a simple, generic brick breaker game, built in Godot. You can use the presentation as a guide or use your own imagination, but your assignment is to make the game feel more "juicy": kinetic, reactive, physical.

Please list the features you add in the README.md. You will be awarded one point per feature you add (including a soundtrack and sound effects). Some of the features demonstrated in the presentation include:
 - Changing the color of the paddle, ball, and blocks
 - Animate how the blocks and the paddle appear on the screen
 - Squeeze and stretch the paddle
 - Animate the size of the ball when it hits something
 - Wobble the ball after it hits something
 - Animate the color of the ball after it hits something
 - Shake the blocks or the paddle when the ball hits something
 - Add sound effects
 - Add music
 - Add particles when a block is hit
 - Add particles when the paddle is hit
 - Make the blocks fall off the screen when they are hit
 - Make the blocks rotate as they are hit
 - Break the blocks when they are hit
 - Add a comet trail to the ball
 - Add screen shake
 - Add eyes to the paddle
 - Make the eyes blink
 - Make the eyes follow the ball
 - Add a smile to the paddle and animate it based on the location of the ball
 - Add a background to the game
 - etc.

 When you are done, *update the LICENSE and README.md*, commit and push your code to GitHub, and turn in the URL for your repository on Canvas.
